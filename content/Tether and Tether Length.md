Tether Length is an [[association]] principle in [[Leverage Based Frames]].  

This type of connection uses relaxed tonality with a fixed maximum distance to create association.
> For example:
> 		If two partners have a string connected between them they will have little association till they try to walk away from each other at the length of the string they will have full association in the direction of the alignment of the string.  
> 		If you add a weight dangling in the middle of the string association will naturally build sooner and be increased as it approaches maximum distance. 

When using arms to connect which is used with most leverage based frames.  The arms form the tether and provide weight by default.  Muscular engagement however can easily stiffen the arms and reduce how naturally the tether behaves.
It is important to chose what you are relaxing and what you are engaging as a partially relaxed shoulder for example can easily cause issues when the entire force of initiation quickly transfers to it at the end of a tether.

Reduced Tether length can be achieved in two ways.
1. Reducing the maximum length 
>	For example:
>	Connecting hand to shoulder instead of hand to hand. 
2.  Adding weight:
> 	Examples include:
> 		Locking musculature in place that reduces the tether before load is placed on it.  
> 			It is important to engage this in an isolated manner so all other muscles in the tether are relaxed.  This allows tether principles to apply while maintaining the reduced tether.
> 		Relaxing completely making the weight apply better.

It is important to apply muscular engagement before exceeding the planned length of the tether.  Using muscular engagement in the tether to shorten it creates a situation of a 2x speed forced readjustment of the frame that follow must compensate for.  This is almost universally harsh on the follower and is known as [[rocket leading]] see [[force leading]].

Advantages of using tether to build association include:
1. Allowing default relaxation for depth of communication. 
2. Building association using physics principles both feelable and and visible by the partner.
3. Association that is inherently equal.
4. High energy potential at the end of tethers due to 100% association with less musculature active to tire out.

Disadvantages of Tethers
1. Vulnerability in said relaxation if a party tries to force lead something.  [[Defencive Dancing]]
2. Little to no potential to initiate in directions not aligned with said tether.
3.  Little ability to control [[Eddy Forces]] in the connection.
	- You maintain the ability to control such internal to each partner's body.

Overall Tethers are a useful but not universally applicable skill that allows for much more efficient energy use and wear on the body.
