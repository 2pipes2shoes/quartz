Momentum absorption is a skill used as an initiation or for safety reasons in partner dance.  There are two main forms of this in partner dance 
[[Absorbing Downwards]]
[[Absorbing Upwards]]
Both can be done solo or with a partner.

Both serve to reduce the amount of momentum that is currently in the body.




[[Emergency Bakes]]
[[Grounding]]
