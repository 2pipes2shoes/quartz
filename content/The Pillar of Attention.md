##### *What is Attention:* 
Attention is the ability to choose and focus your awareness on specific stimuli.  Many different neurological sub-processes combine to create our ability for attention.  Six different types of attention have been identified and defined by studies:

- Arousal: Refers to our activation level and level of alertness, whether we are tired or energized.
    
- Focused Attention: Refers to our ability to focus attention on a stimulus.
    
- Sustained Attention: The ability to attend to a stimulus or activity over a long period of time.
    
- Selective Attention: The ability to attend to a specific stimulus or activity in the presence of other distracting stimuli.
    
- Alternating Attention: The ability to change focus attention between two or more stimuli.
    
- Divided Attention: The ability to attend different stimuli or attention at the same time.
    

Some examples of areas attention can be applied include: technique, competition, emotion, playfulness, presence, dynamism, dreamscape, connection, disassociation, internal, external, sensuality, co-creation, musicality, rhythm, breath, the sensorium, storytelling, plot twists, acting, and so much more!
