Tether Length is an [[association]] principle in [[Leverage Based Frames]].
To build association it is tempting to engage additional musculature creating [[Tone]].
In Tether ideas we instead set a distance between our partner that allows relaxation while still building association.  The further we stand away from our partner the more association builds to the point where it becomes absolute at least in the direction of the connection.
This is advantageous because it allows complete relaxation in the arm musculature.  
Not a hand to hand connection requires less distance then say a hand to shoulder or hand to hip.
closer frames with leverage are rarer but say locked elbows can also be a closer tether.  

Artificially reduced tether length.
