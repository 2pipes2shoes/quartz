[[Pillars]]
What is Rotational Energy:  Movement (kinetic) energy due to rotation of an object around an axis.  For rotation to occur dancers must define a direction, an angular velocity (rate of the turn/rotations per second), and an axis of rotation.  An axis is a line at the center of rotation around which rotation occurs.  

The purpose of Rotational Energy:  Turns fulfill both aesthetic and functional elements  in partner dance.  A dancer can rotate to add aesthetic embellishment, remain in place, or travel through space.  In partner dance, turns can also change how a dancer is moving relative to their partner.  Rotational Energy can be used to transfer energy or momentum between one dancer and another, it can be used for a sudden changes of direction using the least amount of energy or space, and for a dancer to change their rate of movement relative to their partner,

Finite Turn Theory: Turn momentum is finite - A turning dancer allows friction to affect their rotational momentum slowing their turn - so leaders must reinitiate each turn in order to maintain rotational momentum.   

Infinite Turn Theory: Rotational momentum is infinite (Friction is ignored / is overcome with torque created by the turning dancer between their own body and the floor and moments of inertia created by continuously drawing into themselves).  This theory in practice means leaders offer a relaxed connection and the follow stays in continuous rotational motion turning until an end point to the turn is specifically led.

Why Rotational Energy Matters: Turns are an important part of partner dance vocabulary that can be aesthetically pleasing and serve many different practical functions in partner dance.

Elements of a turn a leader can influence while initiating turns:

1. Direction
    
2. Angular momentum
    
3. Axis of rotation (including on or off axis)
    
4. Radius of turn
    
5. Change in radius of the turn (fixed, increasing, or decreasing) 
    
6. Stationary or Traveling (and distance traveled)
    
7. Tether length
    
8. Tone
    
9. Finite or Infinite Turn Theory
    
10. Shaping
    
11. Elevation
    
12. The end point of a turn
    
13. Pistons and Pivots to redirect rotational momentum
    

Elements of a turn a follower can influence: 

14. Styling
    
15. Shaping
    
16. Moment of Inertia (how one is holding or moving their body relative to their axis)
    
17. Balance (internal muscular control)
    
18. Association gradient between the initiation energy and your own core (how much energy you are taking from the lead to initiate or maintain a turn).
