##### *What is Connection?:*
Connection is the association between a dancer’s body and a shared center of gravity within a dance partnership.  

A primary connection point is the active point of association between one dancer and another.  If there is any communication through other connection points they should not be in conflict with the primary connection point.   

For example, when holding hands, the hands would be the primary connection point.  That connection point is also associated with each dancer’s center (by applying tone) and used to communicate movement to each other.  

##### *The Purpose of Connection:* 
Connection is used to create communication between a dancer’s center of gravity in their own body and the shared center of gravity between partners.  Connection can also allow for communication visually, spatially, rhythmically, verbally, emotionally, etc.  In the Fusion Framework, connection with your dance partner(s) is primary and is prioritized over other elements of dance. 

##### *Why Connection Matters:*  
Continuously sending communication through a connection point lets your partner know where you are and how you’re moving at any given moment.  With this constant communication it becomes safe and easeful to fuse different dance forms together as both dancers dynamically adjust to what is communicated in real time.  

#### Concepts for further exploration within connection:
 - [[Connection Points]]  (primary, alternative, lower and leg, rolling and traveling connection points).
 - [[Leverage]] 
 - [[Compression]]
 - [[The Speed of Connection]] (moving at the speed your partner is able to match in real time without lag.)
 - [[Lag]] (extending from your center of gravity into the connection point)
 - [[Seek]] (extending from your center of gravity into the connection point)
