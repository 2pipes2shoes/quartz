Fundamentally it is impossible for the incorporator to match their partner in real time.  There is a delay.  This delay might be in neural response, processing time, deformation or flexion.
All of these create an amount of lag before incorporation occurs.  
That means matching your partner in real time is impossible.

Even without those factors you would run into fundamental physics principles like the Hinesburg Uncertainty principle or the light delay.

Either way matching your partner is impossible.

Lag is inherent but is validated and utilized as a dimension in fusion.  Increasing [[association]] can decrease but not remove lag while decreasing association can increase it. Increased lag removes the real time matching element of incorporation that allows the incorporator to deviate from the initiators expression.

Lag is useful as a defensive dancing mechanism, a Incorporator expression medium, a signal to slow down the dance and if needed a way to stop the dance by never rejoining your partner.
