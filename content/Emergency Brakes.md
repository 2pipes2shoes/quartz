Emergency Brakes are used to prevent collisions or other accidents. It is a technique that uses a combination of differing principles towards an amalgamation of its end goal:

Bringing you and your partner to a complete stop as quickly as possible.

1. Establish or increase a connection point with your partner in a way that can absorb their momentum.
2. Increase your connection with the ground.
3. Increase the association between the two until your partner comes to a stop.  This creates a hard stop that communicates that you are stopping and you need them to stop as well.

This is done when about to collide with an external object be that other dancers, walls, furniture or other obstructions.
