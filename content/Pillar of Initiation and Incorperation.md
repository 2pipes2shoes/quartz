##### *What is Initiation (Lead) and Incorporation (Follow)?:* 
Initiation and Incorporation, more commonly known as Lead and Follow, are counterbalanced roles on a spectrum of role possibilities in fusion partner dance.  

The Initiator (Leader): Is a role that creates a connection point and then sends energy to their partner(s) through that connection.  By taking initiative, a dancer becomes a leader by default.  The lead role can only be taken by someone who chooses to initiate.

The Incorporator (Follower): A role that receives initiations and incorporates them into their own body either directly as it was led, or by interpreting and modifying it.  

The Initiator (Leader): 

1. Creates and modifies primary connection points. 

2. Initiates through shared connection points.  

3. Defines the dimensions of a movement and invites a partner's interpretation. (To maintain safety and body integrity).

The Incorporator (Follower): 

1. Maintains the primary connection point. 

2. Once set in motion, stays in motion until otherwise led. 

3.  Integrates the leader’s invitations for movement through the connection by: accepting, modifying or declining what is led.

The Purpose of Initiation and Incorporation Roles:  The spectrum of Initiation and Incorporation roles are used to define a structure for communication so dancers can  communicate smoothly without “talking” over one another.  

##### *Why Initiation and Incorporation Matters:*
If two people initiate at the same time it can feel jarring, uncomfortable, and possibly cause injury.  To avoid this it is best to verbally establish available roles with your partner(s) in advance (or if it is within you and your partner’s capability you can establish a mutual understanding with your partner that roles will be negotiated non-vocally in real time throughout the dance).  If you set expectations, and know what spectrum of roles will be available in each dance, then communication between dancers can happen smoothly minimizing the risk of injury.   

Social etiquette in Fusion dance involves verbally asking your partner at the beginning of a dance, “Do you have a role preference?” or “Would you like to lead, follow, or switch?”        

In the Fusion Framework the spectrum of role preferences includes:

a. Traditional Lead and Follow - traditionally separate and distinct roles of lead and follow that do not overlap or switch.  Answer the question of role preference with “I’d like to lead.” or “I’d like to follow.”

b. Predefined Switching - where each person takes clearly defined turns leading and following.  This switch can occur by offering to change roles verbally or by obviously changing the frame and hand positions.  Answer the question of role preference with “I’d like to have a switch dance.”

c. Actively Communicated Switching - A fully collaborative eb and flow where each dancer has equal autonomy to express their ideas taking turns leading and following actively communicated through the connection point. Answer the question of role preference with “I’d like to actively communicate roles.”

d. No defined roles - Lead and follow roles can become unnecessary and completely melt away when people are moving at the speed of connection or have established a fully shared center (like in contact improv, push hands, compression based frame, or some styles of micro fusion).  Answer the question of role preference with “I’d like to have no defined roles.” 

#### Concepts for further exploration within Initiation and Incorporation include:

- [[Change of Frame Lead]] (CoFL) - A Change of Frame Lead is one of two primary types of initiation.  CoFL changes the relationship between your center and the shared center.  This change of frame leads your partner to match by changing their relationship with the shared center in a similar way.
	- An Initiation that changes the relationship between the initiator and incorporator.  (One that does not take energy from the ground as its primary energy of initiation)
- [[Leverage]] and [[Compression]] changes
- Changes of [[Connection Points|Connection Point]].
- [[Bowing]]
- [[Presence]]
- [[Engagement/Relaxation]]
- [[Parallel Motion Lead]] (PML) - A Parallel Motion Lead is the second primary initiation type.  PML’s move the shared center in a unified direction, with both dancers moving their individual centers along the same or a parallel line.  
- An Initiation that maintains the relationship between the initiator and incorporator while adding energy to move the whole frame/partnership.
- [Impetus Lead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rmS8eO_F8f5B-4K9Zg4YYCjJAMfZA5e-Ajd4cgQfFLs/edit?usp=sharing) (IL) - An Impetus Lead uses a pulse of energy delivered with relaxation and initiation in order to intentionally create a delay in incorporation.  This delay allows dancers to initiate relaxed flow with potentially rippling effects through different shapes of the body.
- [[Negative Space Lead]] (NSP)
- [[Shaping Lead]] (SL)
- [[Follower voice and agency]]
- [[Styling]]
- [[Impetus]](the force that moves the body)  Usually used in situations where energy is expressing in a particular place rather than the more common connection as a whole.
