You are asking two different things. First, how to link to blocks in other notes, and also how to create an alias for a link.

Firstly, to create a [link to a block in another file 1.1k](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Link+to+blocks). Typing `[[filename^` or `[[^^` will bring up a modal you can type in to search for a specific block within other notes. If you want to link to a block within the same note, use a single chevron.

Secondly, after selecting the block you would like to link to, you can use the pipe character `|` after the link text but within the same `[[]]` to create an alias for the link.

When creating a link with an alias, it would be formatted as `[[B.md|#2]]`; this would show `#2` as the link text inline but navigate to `B.md` when clicked. So in your case, you would have the link to the specific block rather than B.md.

Look at [Link with aliases 1.1k](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Add+aliases+to+note#Link+with+aliases) in the help guide on this topic for a better understanding.
